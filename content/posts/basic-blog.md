Let me start by saying thank you to the team of students from [Northeastern’s SCOUT](https://scout.camd.northeastern.edu/) who put this beautiful site together: [Gino](https://www.ginojacob.com/), [Franny](https://www.frannykuth.com/), [Eric](https://www.erickim.io/), [Jean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-zhang/), [Thomas](https://www.thomas.wang/), [Layla](https://laylabaghai.myportfolio.com/), [Shannon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannon-haley/) H., [Shannon](http://shannonreilly.me/) R. [Joseph](https://josephmannis.com/), [Catu](https://catalinaberretta.com/), [Andrea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-barrios-duran/), and probably others behind the scenes that I did not get to meet. Thank you! I hope your work helps spark people's curiosity to explore why B612 might be something they’ll use one day. I also hope that your work and what we came up with inspires others who are starting their own projects to tell their story the way they want to. There is no recipe. So do it the way that makes sense to you. I wish you all the best on what's next on each of your journeys!

I think this where I’m now supposed to write this elegant blog post detailing out every single detail about what B612 is, what its core features and benefits are, what every moment of using this product will feel like and blah, blah, blah.

But part of me doesn't want to do that (yet). I'd like to tell you what led me to start B612 and why you might come to enjoy it.

## Many simple moments.

I had been working at Amazon in Seattle for over six years and sensed that something wasn’t sitting quite right for me. I found it difficult to talk about it. Shouldn’t I have been satisfied with this job? What was this voice in the back of my head telling me it wasn’t right? A part of me was fighting to stay focused on the job I was blessed to have but the other was constantly day-dreaming about ideas that seemed out of reach. I was at a crossroads and I wasn't sure which path to follow.

In the months leading up to my decision to leave, I would come to work and the first thing I’d do was drop my things at my desk, grab my laptop, and head down to the coffee shop for an espresso. This became a sort of escape for me. It was a simple moment I always looked forward to that soothed my mind from the uncertainty of choosing which path to follow next. I didn’t know it then, but it is these small moments, among many others, that helped me process what I was going through, the advice I was hearing from close ones, and what I wanted to do next.

I remember the day I walked into my manager’s office to share that I would be leaving like it was yesterday. I would usually be nervous on days like this one, but at that very moment, I felt calm. Everything around me felt calm. My heart. The atmosphere. The people. It felt right. That moment of stillness marked the beginning a new adventure.

I had thousands of questions and zero answers but I thought deep down it was all worth figuring out even just for myself...for my peace of mind.

The project started off with the idea to build out modular cabins in nature...a network of cabins of sorts. It was a cool idea with its many flaws like any other. But after a year of work, something, again, wasn't sitting quite right. I was scared out of my mind, I was up against a massive decision, and I wasn’t sure this idea was what I personally wanted to do after all. I found myself right back at the starting point. At another crossroads.

The moment I decided to change direction with this venture was near-instantaneous. And, once again, I thought back to all the simple moments over the year that had led me to this one decision. The most profound moments were those where I could feel the stillness around me. Where, just like my espressos in the morning, I could escape and think. Sometimes that happened to be in nature on top of a mountain and other times it was in my bedroom or in the car listening to music. There are just too many to list them all.

Those small moments are what led me to build B612.

## So what is B612 anyways?

B612 is a private space that you can rent when you need a simple moment to disconnect. I know it’s hard to understand right away without seeing a picture of it but think of it as a new way to enjoy a small moment of stillness. A sort of true vacation for your mind. The same way you may already do that today by getting an espresso, or going on a trip, or taking a yoga class, or maybe something else.

But B612 is so much more than that.

It is a call to adventure, a pathway to discovering your own curiosity and imagination, or maybe an inspiration to learn something about yourself. It is a safe space where you can be still in this incredibly fast pace world unfolding around us. It is a space where you can have a simple and quiet moment to yourself (or with a close one) away from it all. Actually, maybe one of those many simple moments on your journey that might help you at your own crossroads.

And so now that I might have your attention or that you might be intrigued, your next natural question, will be…well ok cool story, but what does this space actually look like?

I will share that with you soon. I am building it as we speak. In the meantime, I invite you, through this simple and beautiful website, to take a moment and explore what this private space might be for you and why you might one day find yourself using it.

I can't wait to invite you to spend a small moment at B612, soon.

À bientôt!

Bertrand.
