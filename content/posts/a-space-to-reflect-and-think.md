Are you familiar with that special feeling you get when reaching the summit of a mountain? The end of a trail? When the weather turns and you are in the clouds for a brief moment? When you pause on your way somewhere and just look around? When you walk to the park and arrive at that perfect patch of grass? When you look out your window and you catch the final glimpse of the day’s sunset on the horizon?

It’s a special feeling. During those moments, things can feel a little weightless so-to-speak…Your gaze rises and you pause for a moment to take in your surroundings. It’s a bliss moment. But if you don’t pay attention to it, it’s a moment that quickly passes and is easily forgotten. In that moment however you see something that doesn’t come around every day. All the noise around you melts away and for that brief moment at the top of the mountain, at the end of the trail, while you gaze up at the clouds or at the sunset, something beautiful happens in your mind.

Clarity is born.

You reflect at that moment. Take stock of where you are, what is important to you, what you should focus on. That moment helps you reflect in a way other moments in your day-to-day don’t allow you to. Because you’re busy working. Busy giving attention to things that don’t particularly matter. Busy writing emails that may not actually be necessary. Busy watching and listening to what everyone else is up to. Busy doing the things that we are told we “should” do but that maybe don’t serve us all that much.

Where does that moment of reflection lead you to? What do you do next? What ideas are born from that moment of clarity? Are you paying attention to when these moments happen?

At B612, you can experience that moment of reflection. That weightlessness of reaching the summit of a mountain so-to-speak.

À bientôt!
